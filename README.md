## A1 Logical_Operator 

Prompt the user to enter two truth values, x and y.

Assume the user will enter T or F.

The program displays the following and will end.
¬x                (use the ~ character)
x v y            (use the v character)
x ^ y
x → y           (use the - - > characters)

Run your program 4 times, with the following user input

T, T
T, F

F, F
